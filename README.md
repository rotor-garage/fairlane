# Fairlane

The Fairlaine is an ```R``` designed 215mm motor to motor 5" racing and freestyle frame.


>Presence of this frame is said to warm a thousand motors and without effort fascinate the soul and want to go faster. The cheerful and playful potential animates all that are fortunate enough to encounter footage of a flight. 

Specification:
* 215mm mtm "stretch" frame
* Nominal 1.25:1 ratio (L:W)
* Under 600g AUW racing, 600-750g freestyle (depending on HD cam)
* 22xx motors
* 5 inch props
* 30.5mm FC mount (KISS, CF/BF, etc)
* Underslung battery, single strap
* 20-35mm standoff depending on components and build
* Fits HS1177 type flight camera

### Target Pilot

Medium or greater experience. Not the best first build but also not the hardest by any means. The Fairlane is fast and once tuned horizontal and vertical acceleration is thrilling. When performing freestyle with high rates the Fairlane sounds like a knife fight in the sky.

### Building the Fairlane

* The frame design requires a good control of wires, length, and direct connection (solder not bullets). 
* ESCs are mounted on the arms as per the builders preference.
* The flight controller is center mounted and can be fastened using bolts or plastic means. Both spacers and standoff stacks are possible in material and format of choice.
* The top plate attaches via standoff (20 to 35mm is common) and is provided to yield tight support for common cameras (GoPro, Mobius, Runcam, etc).
	* Mounting is a per-camera operation, but Creative Dex type mounts work fine
* 4s 1300-1800mah recommended. 3s is also good, just less voltage and the same mah.
* Stack mounted PDB is recommended
* VTX 
	* Mount under top plate easily, other mounting options are available on a per build basis
	* Racing/vertical mount possible, depends on standoff height and vtx
	* Stack VTX is fine. Beware EM and stack height issues
	* Top of top plate not a recommended mount
	* Right angle antenna connection suggested (pigtail/strait also compatible)
	* FX79* form factor is an easy fit
* Camera (HS1177 form) allows 20 to 45+ degree
